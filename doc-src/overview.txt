@page overview Overview

Photoropter is a C++ library to correct a series of flaws commonly found in
images taken with digital cameras. The library aims to be reasonably light-weight,
yet providing a clean interface and proper code encapsulation.

Templates and inheritance are used extensively inside the library. However, one
does usually not have to deal with those in order to use Photoropter. The current
API is pure object oriented C++, and thus the library cannot be called from a C program
directly. However, writing the needed adapter code is usually quite simple and
straightforward, and I will be glad to advise you on that matter.

@section intro_devenv Development environment

Photoropter is developed on a Linux machine using the GNU compiler collection (GCC),
currently version 4.4. It should be quite portable, and any compiler supporting a reasonable
subset of ANSI C++ should work. The only feature that can be considered partially non-standard
is the usage of the ISO/C99 header "stdint.h". However, almost all current C++ compilers
also support a sufficiently large subset of ISO/C99, so this should not be a problem.

For building and configuring the sources, the powerful CMake system is used. This also
should enable Photoropter to be built on a variety of systems using different compilers.
However, currently no other compilers apart from GCC 4 on POSIX systems have been tested.
Feedback and fixes to the build scripts are welcome.
