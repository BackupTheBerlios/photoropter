@page overview Overview

Photoropter is a C++ library to correct a series of flaws commonly found in
images taken with digital cameras. The library aims to be reasonably
light-weight, yet providing a clean interface and proper code encapsulation.

Templates and inheritance are used extensively inside the library. However, one
does usually not have to deal with those in order to use Photoropter. The
current API is pure object oriented C++, and thus the library cannot be called
from a C program directly. However, writing the needed adapter code is usually
quite simple and straightforward, and I will be glad to advise you on that
matter.

@section intro_devenv Development environment

Photoropter is developed on a AMD64 Linux machine using the GNU compiler
collection (GCC), currently version 4.4. It should be quite portable, and any
compiler supporting a reasonable subset of ANSI C++ should work. The only
feature that can be considered partially non-standard is the usage of the
ISO/C99 header "stdint.h". However, almost all current C++ compilers also
support a sufficiently large subset of ISO/C99, so this should not be a problem.

For building and configuring the sources, the powerful CMake system is used.
This also should enable Photoropter to be built on a variety of systems using
different compilers. For example, after installing a third-party version of
'stdint.h', both Photoropter and its example application built without problems
using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. The library itself has not further
dependencies (however, for the example application to work, both Boost and VXL
have to be installed).
