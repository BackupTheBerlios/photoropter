The Photoropter library itself is distributed under the terms of the
@ref mit-lic. All accompanying utility programs are distributed under the
terms of the @ref gpl.

This effectively means that you <em>can</em> use Photoropter in just about
any software, provided you give credit for it. However, all utility programs
(e.g., for lens database maintenance or calibration, yet to be written) are
copylefted. You have been warned.

@section licens_contrib How to contribute

Photoropter is not only open source software: it is free software. This means
that you are free to change Photoropter in just about any way you like,
including (but not limited to) bug fixes and improvements to its functionality.
You are invited to make your changes available to the project, so that everybody
can benefit.

I will be happy to look at any suggested patch. However, please be aware
that this does not necessarily mean your change will immediately be adopted
into Photoropter. The following points are also worthy of note:
<ul>
<li>By sending me a patch, you irrevocably provide your changes under
the terms of the MIT license or the GPL respectively, depending on which
part of Photoropter you contributed to.</li>
<li>You agree to indemnify me from and against any copyright violations
you may or may not have committed. This essentially means that if you steal
code from someone else and present it to me as your own, I \em will
make you regret it.</li>
<li>For the moment, the easiest way to send me your contributions is by
sending me a patch file via mail.</li>
</ul>
