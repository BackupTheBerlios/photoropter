@page techback_geom Lens geometries

Disregarding unintended distortions and limited depth of field, 
the lens optics of most cameras produce images that are (nearly)
identical to those produced by a pinhole camera. The characteristic
property of a pinhole projection is that straight lines are always
mapped to straight lines. Because of that property, the pinhole or
rectilinear (also sometimes called 'gnomonic') projection is often
referred to as 'distortion-free'. However, this depends on what
one regards as image distortions, and for special applications
camera optics exist that implement different coordinate mappings. 

@section techback_geom_rect Rectilinear projection

The rectilinear projection satisfies the following equation:
@f[r=f\tan(\theta),@f]
where r is the distance from the image centre, f is the
effective focal length of the lens system and
@f$\theta@f$ is the inclination angle.

As mentioned before, this projection always maps straight lines
to straight lines, because of which it is preferred for architectural
shots and also often called 'distortion-free'. However, at short
focal lengths objects near the image border tend to appear
noticeably larger than they actually are, since the tan function
diverges for large angles (i.e., @f$\theta\to\pi/2@f$).

This is the projection that is implemented by most camera optics
by a fair margin. However, many zooms and wide-angle lenses show
some amount of geometric aberration (which of course can be corrected
using Photoropter).

@section techback_geom_fish Fisheye projections

@subsection techback_geom_equidist 'Equidistant' fisheye projection

The simplest projection that does not diverge for @f$\theta\to\pi/2@f$ is
the one that satisfies
@f[r=f\theta.@f]
In this projection, the distance from the image centre is proportional
to the inclination angle, and thus it is possible to even map the complete
solid angle of @f$\Omega=4\pi@f$ to the image plane.

This projection is used by the PanoTools suite (and thus also by Hugin)
when 'fisheye' is selected as input geometry. Quite a lot of fisheye lenses
implement it or the equisolid geometry (which shows similar properties).

@subsection techback_geom_equisolid 'Equisolid angle' fisheye projection

This projection satisfies
@f[r=2f\sin(\theta/2).@f]
It is the second popular fisheye mapping for which quite a lot of lenses
have been built. For inclination angles @f$\theta<\pi/2@f$, there is not
too much difference to equidistant types, and actually most real-life
lenses implement a mapping function that is 'something in between' the two.

The equisolid angle projection gets its name from the property that
areas of objects remain unchanged. Because of that it used to be popular
in weather monitoring. However, marginal objects get 'squished'
quite strongly (especially for @f$\theta>\pi/2@f$), so their proportions
do not remain the same.

@subsection techback_geom_stereo 'Stereographic' fisheye projection

This rather rare projection follows
@f[r=2f\tan(\theta/2).@f]
It shows the interesting property that perpendicular lines remain
perpendicular, and thus is a 'conformal' projection. The results are
often regarded as visually pleasing, since a stereographic projection does
not distort the area of marginal objects too much while retaining
their proportions.

To my knowledge only one lens has been developed for this projection
type so far (i.e., the Samyang/Vivitar 8mm diagonal fisheye for
APS-C type cameras).

@subsection techback_geom_ortho 'Orthographic' fisheye projection

The fourth fisheye projection is called 'orthographic' and is
also extremely rare. Its formula is
@f[r=f\sin(\theta).@f]

The only lens that I know of to ever implement orthographic projection
was the "OP Fisheye-NIKKOR 10mm f/5.6" by Nikon (developed in the
late 1960s, it is now extremely difficult to get). Orthographic projection
tends to compress marginal objects quite strongly, thus emphasising the
image centre. It is limited to inclination angles @f$\theta\leq\pi/2\f$.

@section techback_geom_comparison Comparison of the different mapping functions

When looking at the mapping functions of the different projections, we get
the following result:
@image html fisheye1.png "Comparison of different projection functions"

The rectilinear function diverges quickly, while the fisheye projections
remain bounded. Given a fixed focal length, the larger angles can be mapped
to significantly different distances from the center. Especially the
stereographic and orthographic mappings show a noticeably different behaviour
to the equidistant and equisolid mappings.

If we postulate a fixed viewing angle of 180 degrees over the image
diagonal of an APS-C type camera, we get different focal lengths for
the different lens types as a result:
@image html fisheye2.png "Different focal lengths for fixed viewing angle"

Therefore e.g. an 8mm Peleng fisheye (which more or less implements an
equidistant mapping) supports full 180° viewing angle even on a
crop factor of 1.6, while the aforementioned Samyang 8mm achieves
"only" about 160 (crop 1.6) to 168 (crop 1.5) degrees due to its
stereographic mapping function. When looking e.g. at Four Thirds (as the
smallest 'cropped' sensor used in DSLR cameras with a crop factor 2.0),
one gets a viewing angle of roughly 155° for the equidistant and  136° for
the stereographic case.
