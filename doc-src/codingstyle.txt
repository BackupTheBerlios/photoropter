@section code_org Code organisation

@subsection code_org_classes Classes and structs

<ul>
<li>The interface of polymorphic classes is extracted in form of a
(fully abstract) interface class, from which all the implementing classes
inherit.</li>
<li>Semantically different parts of a class's interface are
extracted into separate interface definitions.</li>
<li>Usually a header contains only a single class
definition. Exception: closely related interface definitons that form
a coherent unit.</li>
</ul>

@subsection code_org_misc Miscellaneous

<ul>
<li>Variables are declared one by one, each in a separate declaration
statement.</li>
<li>Functions that receive objects as parameters use references to the
interface base class wherever possible.</li>
<li>Enumerations are usually placed inside their own descriptive namespace and
given a generic name like e.g. 'type'. This allows to refer to both
the enumeration as a whole as well as its values by using the
descriptive sub-namespace, and thus avoids namespace pollution. </li>
</ul>

@section formatting Formatting

<ul>
<li>The source code is formatted according to the ANSI style.</li>
<li>Scope braces ('curly braces') are usually placed on separate lines.</li>
<li>Blocks are indented by 4 spaces. However, the corresponding scope braces
are not indented.</li>
<li>A sample configuration file for the astyle code formatter is provided.</li>
</ul>

@section naming Naming

@subsection naming_general General

<ul>
<li>All identifiers are plain English.</li>
<li>Identifiers are descriptive. Especially very short names
like i,k,l or x,y,z are used only for very shortlived variables (e.g.,
loop counters), and only if there cannot be any doubt about their
purpose.</li>
<li>Variables and typedefs are written in small letters, only using
[a-z0-9] as characters.</li>
<li>Variables and typedefs that contain more than one word are separated
using "_".</li>
<li>Typedefs are marked with a "_t" suffix.</li>
<li>Private variables in classes are marked with a single "_" suffix.</li>
</ul>

@subsection naming_classes Classes and structs

<ul>
<li>The same naming principles apply, with the following exceptions.</li>
<li>The first letter of a class name is capitalised. The following
letters remain lower-case.</li>
<li>Multiple words in a class name are separated by capitalisation
rather than "_" (i.e., 'camel casing' is used).</li>
<li>Interface definitions (i.e., fully abstract class definitions) are
marked by an initial letter "I". This is not considered the first
letter of the class name (i.e., (2) still applies).</li>
</ul>

@section langfeatures Language features

<ul>
<li>The 'const' keyword is used proactively.</li>
<li>Namespaces are used wherever sensible. Semantically independent
parts of the code reside in separate namespaces.</li>
<li>The 'using' keyword is generally avoided, especially in the form
'using namespace [...]' at global scope.</li>
<li>Multiple inheritance is generally avoided. Exception: inheritance
of interface class definitions.</li>
</ul>
