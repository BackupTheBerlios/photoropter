This text will give a short overview of how Photoropter is used.

@section tutorial_memviews Memory access and image views

The most important point when using an algorithmic library like Photoropter is
always: how will the library access my data? Photoropter works on images, and
images in memory come in a myriad of formats. Fortunately, only a few are really
common, and those are easily accommodated. The concept by which Photoropter
accesses image data is called a 'view', and it is used like this:

@code
#include <photoropter/mem_image_view_r.h>
#include <photoropter/mem_image_view_w.h>
[...]

void* src_ptr;
void* dst_ptr;
size_t img_width;
size_t img_height;
[...]

using namespace phtr;
const mem::Storage::type storage_type = mem::Storage::rgb_8_inter;

typedef MemImageViewR<storage_type> view_r_t;
typedef MemImageViewW<storage_type> view_w_t;

view_r_t src_img_view(src_ptr, img_width, img_height);
view_w_t dst_img_view(dst_ptr, img_width, img_height);
@endcode

And that's all. This will create two image views for Photoropter to work with
(one for reading and one for writing). Since a reading view is strictly
read-only, an instance can even work directly on top of your application's image
data.

@section tutorial_ptlens PTLens correction

Now let's perform a geometric transformation on the image. For this, we have to
decide the interpolation method Photoropter shall use; bilinear interpolation
yields reasonable quality and is quite fast, so we will use that one here.

@code
#include <photoropter/image_transform.h>
[...]

typedef InterpolatorBilinear<view_r_t> interp_t;
typedef ImageTransform<interp_t, view_w_t> transform_t;

transform_t transform(src_img_view, dst_img_view);
@endcode

An even easier way to set up the transformation object would be through
a factory function:

@code
#include <photoropter/image_transform.h>
[...]

std::auto_ptr<IImageTransform> transform(get_image_transform(Interpolation::Bilinear, src_img_view, dst_img_view));
@endcode

Now we have a transformation object which works on the two views we created
earlier. The latter holds three transformation queues: two for geometrical and one
for colour transformations. Of course, the PTLens model is a geometrical one.
Furthermore, it can work both on the pixel and on the subpixel level, allowing
very sophisticated TCA corrections (i.e. essentially the same as Hugin's
fulla tool provides). At this point we are interested in a purely
geometrical correction, so we use only the pixel queue.

@code
#include <photoropter/model/pixel_correction_model.h>
[...]

double aspect = static_cast<double>(img_width) /
static_cast<double>(img_height);
model::PTLensGeomModel ptlens_mod(aspect);

ptlens_mod.set_model_params(0.0, 0.00987, -0.05127);

transform.pixel_queue().add_model(ptlens_mod);
@endcode

The PTLens model requires an aspect ratio parameter, because (in theory at
least) Photoropter is completely aspect ratio agnostic and can work even on
anamorphic images. Because of this, all transformations are performed in a
normalised coordinate system, and thus the PTLens model simply does not know
(and for the most part, does not have to know) the image size. However, a common
operation is to convert parameters between portrait and landscape, and for this,
PTLens has to know the aspect ratio. For more details, see
@ref techback_phtrcoord.

We have now successfully set up Photoropter to perform a PTLens correction. All
that is left is to tell it to actually perform the desired corrections:
@code
transform.do_transform();
@endcode

And that's it, actually. The transformation loop is highly optimised (making use
even of multiple CPU cores), so it should be done quite quickly. Of course,
there's much more that Photoropter can do, e.g. dealing with different forms of
regions of interest (ROI), gamma handling, colour corrections... this was just a
first example. If you want to see a bit more, have a look inside the 'phtrx'
demo application: it shows a larger subset of Photoropter's abilities.
