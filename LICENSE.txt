Photoropter Licenses

The Photoropter library itself is distributed under the terms of the
MIT/X11 license. All accompanying utility programs are distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3.

This effectively means that you can use Photoropter in just about
any software, provided you give credit for it. However, all utility programs
(e.g., for lens database maintenance or calibration, yet to be written) are
copylefted. You have been warned.
