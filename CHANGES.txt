List of changes
===============

0.1.0
-----

-phtrtest has been renamed to phtrx.
-Lens geometry conversion is now supported.
-Lots of refactoring and namespace restructuring.
-The image transform has now distinct 'pixel' and 'subpixel' queues. Some
models work with both (e.g. PTLens), while others only will work in the pixel
queue (e.g. geometry conversion).
-Support for automatic scaling of the result image to suppress black borders
(experimental).

0.0.6
-----

-Rewrite of phtrtest: now allows to access a greater subset of Photoropter's
functions (including runtime selection of interpolation type and oversampling);
also much cleaner code structure
-Command line syntax approximating the one of fulla: -r, -g, -b, -c and -x are
the same now (so phtrtest can now replicate fulla's results in many cases)
-PTLens TCA correction ('fulla-style') working and producing results identical
to fulla
-Linear scaler model implemented: can be used both for image scaling and for
simple linear TCA correction (i.e., the same model lensfun supports)

0.0.5
-----

-Refactoring to make image transformation more agnostic of
pixel format (preparation for alpha-channel handling)
-Documentation now contains only 'public' parts of API by
default
-Lanczos interpolation support
-RGBA support: the library can now fully deal with alpha channel data;
alpha information will be subject to all geometric transformations (and
ignored in colour transformations).
-PTLens model can now use different parameters on separate channels;
this should enable fulla-style TCA correction (untested as yet).

0.0.4
-----

-Fixed some bugs in EMOR handling code.
-Fixed a clipping bug in gamma handling code.
-Oversampling is runtime-configurable now.
-Some small changes to signatures, inserted some explicit
casts (mainly to make VC++ happy).
-Removed interpolation type as template parameter (historical
remnant) and created different interpolation class templates.
-Fixed some historical errors in the documentation.
-Tutorial updated.

0.0.3
-----

-Initial public release.
