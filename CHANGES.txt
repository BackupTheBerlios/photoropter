List of changes
===============

0.0.5
-----

-Refactoring to make image transformation more agnostic of
pixel format (preparation for alpha-channel handling)
-Documentation now contains only 'public' parts of API by
default
-Lanczos interpolation support
-RGBA support: the library can now fully deal with alpha channel data;
alpha information will be subject to all geometric transformations (and
ignored in colour transformations).
-PTLens model can now use different parameters on separate channels;
this should enable fulla-style TCA correction (untested as yet).

0.0.4
-----

-Fixed some bugs in EMOR handling code.
-Fixed a clipping bug in gamma handling code.
-Oversampling is runtime-configurable now.
-Some small changes to signatures, inserted some explicit
casts (mainly to make VC++ happy).
-Removed interpolation type as template parameter (historical
remnant) and created different interpolation class templates.
-Fixed some historical errors in the documentation.
-Tutorial updated.

0.0.3
-----

-Initial public release.
